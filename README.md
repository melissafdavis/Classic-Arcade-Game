# Classic Arcade Game
## Summary
This is my remix of the classic frogger game, submitted for Udacity's front-end web development nanodegree. 

## How to play the game
Use the arrow keys to move the player:
Up: up-arrow
Down: down-arrow
Left: left-arrow 
Right: right-arrow

The object of the game is to earn as many points as possible by getting to the water without colliding with the bugs. The player earns a point each time he/she makes it to the water. If you collide with the bugs, you lose and a modal will appear giving you the option to play again or leave the game.

## Installation
1. Download or clone the repository to your computer.
2. Open the index html in your browser.
